## Journey Stages

### Stage 1: Assignment Announcement
**Day 1 - Monday, 10:00 AM**

#### Context
- Professor Chen announces design recreation assignment in class
- Students must create an authentic recreation of a historical design style
- Due date: Friday (4 days away)
- Alex chooses Bauhaus as his style

#### Actions
- 📝 Takes notes on assignment requirements
- 💭 Thinks about which style to choose
- 📱 Opens course syllabus on phone to find MyWebClass link

#### Thoughts
> "Okay, Bauhaus sounds interesting. I remember those colorful geometric posters. But what makes it 'authentic'?"

#### Emotions
- 😊 Excited about the creative project
- 😰 Slightly anxious about "authenticity" requirement
- 🤔 Curious about what makes good design

#### Pain Points
- Unclear what "authentic" specifically means
- Many style options, hard to choose
- Short timeline feels stressful

#### Touchpoints
- In-person class lecture
- Course syllabus (PDF)
- MyWebClass.org link in syllabus

**Analytics to Track:**
- **Referral source**: Syllabus link clicks (UTM parameter: utm_source=syllabus_fall2025)
- **First visit timing**: Peak hours (8-10PM student study time)
- **Device breakdown**: Mobile vs. Desktop first visits
- **Bounce rate target**: <35% for first-time visitors from syllabus

#### Opportunities
✅ Clear assignment description in syllabus  
✅ Link to MyWebClass.org provided upfront  
✅ Multiple style examples available

**A/B Testing Opportunities:**
- **Variant A**: Syllabus link to homepage (current)
- **Variant B**: Syllabus link directly to Bauhaus page (22% faster time-to-example hypothesis)

---

### Stage 2: Initial Research
**Day 1 - Monday, 8:00 PM**

- 🖱️ Clicks on "Bauhaus" entry
- 📖 Reads educational explanation
- 🔍 Studies the working demo in iframe
- 📸 Takes screenshots for reference
- 🔗 Opens demo in new tab to inspect closer

#### Thoughts
> "Ohh, I see! Bauhaus uses these primary colors and geometric shapes. The demo shows exactly what it should look like."

> "This explanation about form following function makes sense. And I can see it in the actual demo."

#### Emotions
- 😌 Relieved to find clear examples
- 💡 Enlightened by seeing theory + practice together
- 😍 Inspired by the clean aesthetic
- ✅ Confident she understands now

#### Pain Points
