- 💡 **Motivation:** Get a good grade and build portfolio pieces
- 🏆 **Success:** Create an authentic design that gets approved by instructor
- 📚 **Learning Style:** Visual learner, prefers examples over theory

### Pain Points & Frustrations
- 😤 "I read about Bauhaus but I'm not sure what 'authentic' actually means in practice"
- 😤 "Design history sites show images but not real working examples"
- 😤 "I don't know if my recreation is accurate enough"
- 😤 "Submission systems are often confusing and don't give clear feedback"

### Needs & Requirements
- ✅ See real, working examples of design styles (not just images)
- ✅ Understand the principles behind each style with clear explanations
- ✅ Easy submission process with clear requirements
- ✅ Fast feedback on whether submission meets standards
- ✅ Ability to compare her work to approved examples

### Behaviors & Habits
- Searches for design inspiration on Pinterest and Dribbble
- Bookmarks useful educational resources
- Works on assignments the night before they're due
- Shares cool design finds on Instagram
- Prefers mobile for browsing, desktop for creating

### User Journey Touchpoints
1. **Discovery:** Finds MyWebClass through course syllabus or Google
2. **Exploration:** Browses gallery to see examples
3. **Learning:** Reads educational content about chosen style
4. **Creation:** Works on her own design demo
5. **Submission:** Uploads her work through submission form
6. **Waiting:** Checks back periodically for instructor approval
7. **Celebration:** Shares approved work on social media

### Scenarios & Use Cases

**Scenario 1: Researching Swiss Design**
> Alex has an assignment to create a Swiss Design demo. He visits MyWebClass, finds the Swiss Design entry, studies the working demo, reads about grid systems and typography, and uses it as a reference while creating his own version.

**Scenario 2: Submitting Work**
> After finishing his Bauhaus recreation, Alex goes to the submit page, fills out the form with his name, email, GitHub Pages URL, and uploads a screenshot. He writes a description explaining how he used geometric shapes, primary colors, and sans-serif typography to stay authentic.

**Scenario 3: Checking Status**
> Two days later, Alex returns to check if his submission was approved. He's excited to see it's been accepted and is now displayed in the gallery alongside other student work.

### Quotes
> "I need to see it working, not just a picture in a textbook."

> "If my instructor approves it, I know I understood the style correctly."

> "I love that I can show this in my portfolio as a real project, not just a school assignment."

- **Position:** Associate Professor, Columbia College Chicago
- **Teaching Experience:** 15 years
- **Tech Savviness:** Moderate - comfortable with LMS, email, basic web tools
- **Devices:** Dell laptop, Android phone

### Background & Context
Dr. Chen teaches Design History and Web Development courses. She's passionate about helping students understand design movements through practical application, not just memorization. She is a mentor to all her students, caring and understanding of their situations. She's flexible with rules when students have legitimate challenges. She has 60+ students across three courses and needs efficient ways to review and provide feedback on student work.

### Goals & Motivations
- 🎯 **Primary Goal:** Help students deeply understand design principles
- 💡 **Motivation:** Make design history engaging and practical
- 🏆 **Success:** Students create work that shows true understanding
- 📚 **Teaching Philosophy:** Learning by doing is more effective than lectures

### Pain Points & Frustrations
- 😤 "I spend too much time reviewing submissions that don't meet basic criteria"
- 😤 "Students submit work via different channels (email, Canvas, etc.) - it's chaotic"
- 😤 "Hard to show students good examples of style-accurate recreations"
- 😤 "Explaining 'authenticity' is difficult without concrete references"
- 😤 "No easy way to showcase excellent student work from past semesters"

### Needs & Requirements
- ✅ Centralized submission system for all student work
- ✅ Clear quality standards students can reference
- ✅ Easy approve/reject workflow
- ✅ Curated gallery of high-quality examples
- ✅ Educational content that explains design principles clearly
- ✅ Ability to track submissions and provide feedback

### Behaviors & Habits
- Reviews student work during office hours and evenings
- Uses course website/LMS for most communications
- References established design history resources (Meggs' History of Graphic Design)
- Shares good student work with future classes
- Prefers desktop for grading, mobile for quick checks

### User Journey Touchpoints
1. **Adoption:** Learns about MyWebClass, evaluates for course use
2. **Setup:** Includes site in syllabus, explains to students
3. **Monitoring:** Receives Discord notifications when submissions arrive
4. **Review:** Logs into admin panel to review submissions
5. **Decision:** Approves or rejects based on authenticity criteria
6. **Teaching:** Uses approved examples in lectures
7. **Assessment:** References student submissions in grading

### Scenarios & Use Cases

**Scenario 1: Reviewing Submissions**
> Dr. Mitchell gets a Discord notification that 5 new design submissions have arrived. During his office hours, he opens the review panel, examines each submission's screenshot and demo URL, and checks if the design accurately reflects the stated style. He approves 3 that show clear understanding and rejects 2 with notes.

**Scenario 2: Teaching with Examples**
> In his lecture on Brutalist web design, Dr. Mitchell pulls up MyWebClass on the projector. He shows the Brutalist gallery entry with its working demo and uses it to explain raw HTML aesthetics, intentional "ugly" design, and rejection of ornament. Students can see the principles in action.

**Scenario 3: Suggesting Resources**
> A student asks how to make their Swiss Design more authentic. Dr. Mitchell sends them to MyWebClass's Swiss Design page, which explains grid systems, Helvetica usage, and asymmetric layouts with a working example they can study.

### Quotes
> "I need students to understand the 'why' behind design choices, not just copy the aesthetics."

> "If I can point them to working examples, they learn so much faster than from textbook screenshots."

> "The best way to learn design history is to try to recreate it authentically."
